# README

With the increasing in numbers of Ruby Gems, it becomes progressively important to be able to distinguish them apart.
L.A.S.E.R. is here to do just that.

With searchable abilities and tag searches, you will find the Gem you need in no time.

This is an open source project, so should you wish to contribute, please either make a feature request or a pull request - but please do so on a separate branch or inform us prior to making any changes.
